Full RSS reader application originally released on the App Store in Feb 2017 made public in Mar 2020
Had few unique featuers such as limiting the amount of articles per feed constantly to limit storage, could strip articles of all unneeded data (scripts, formatting, etc.) to leave only text and images, non distracting fullscreen mode, efficient earching, could work offline with all data downloaded and still accessible. Originally supported iOS 6.0.

Has few bugs still probably and could be made more performant at places, esp. database batch pprocessing related tasks (e.g. adding many feeds at once from import)

Use [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) nowadays or something
